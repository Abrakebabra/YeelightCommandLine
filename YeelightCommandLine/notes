Do:
 - Search udp message to multicast address
 - Receive udp response from multicast address
    - Get IP Port search message was sent from
    - Listen to that IP Port for response
    - Get individual light properties
    - Create new tcp connection to each light
    - Save the light connection and properties
 - Create command functions
    - Helper functions for various RGB notations
        - Both rgb to single int, and reverse.  Maybe hex, or another format?
    - Encode JSON
    - Listen for response
        - decode JSON
    - If response received, save command to light properties
    - Music mode?  Create separate TCP connection
    - Color Flow?
 - Work on main program with commands

 - Make a readme

 - ensure only method enum is passed on as valid method


- // case "adjust_ct": - This doesn't make sense
// case "adjust_color": - This doesn't make sense

Fix:
 - Light should actually be a reference type in case it's ever copied.

- Network classes
    - New socket and connect
    - Send and receive both UDP and TCP
    - Isolate socket from NWEndpoint.hostport
    - Listen on that port
